Flaming Alpha
================

Yet another makerspace membership management application.

I'm developing this software to replace SeltzerCRM with a Rails application that I can support and extend. My intent is to have a system I can make available to other officers and hosts for general member management while being comfortable deploying and supporting.

### Planned Features
* Authentication
* Authorization - role based
* Contact management
* Configurable membership plans
* Configurable membership addons & discounts  

SeltzerCRM features I do not plan on supporting - plugin system and the highly configurable role rights.
